How to get the GNURadio Companion Tek RSA demo running:
1. Run the command "sudo ./setup_build_env.sh" in the terminal.
	This script installs many dependencies and is expected to take
	several minutes. You will know the script finished successfully if
	the last line it prints says "Success: setup complete".

2. When that finishes, close the terminal that ran step 1 and open a new terminal.

3. In the new terminal, return to the project root directory
	and enter the command "gnuradio-companion" to verify
	the base program installed correctly. Then exit GNURadio Companion.

4. Enter the command "gedit ~/.gnuradio/grc.conf".
	This will open the file "grc.conf" which will be edited in step 5.

5. Add the following lines to the bottom of the grc.conf file:

[grc]
local_blocks_path = /usr/local/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks/

6. Save the file changes and close the file.

7. Run the demo script "grc_RSA_demo.sh" in the "examples" directory.
	Run it with super-user permission. 
	This should open GNURadio Companion showing a simple setup
	using the Tek RSA blocks.

8. Plug the RSA300 into the computer.

9. In GNURadio Companion, run the setup by clicking Run -> Execute in the toolbar,
	or by clicking the green triangle. A warning message may pop up, but this
	can be dismissed. If everything was set up correctly, you should see
	a Frequency vs. Power graph that is updating using output from the RSA.
