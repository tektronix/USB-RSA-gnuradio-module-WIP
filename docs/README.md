## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress and has not reached a stable v1.0 release yet.

## Description

## Production Environment
This project is meant to be eveloped and install on Linux. If you are not running Linux on your computer, you can run a Vagrant instance (A container system) to run linux. A Vagrantfile is provided in this repo. 
1. Install Vagrant on your Mac/Windows/Linux system [Vagrant Install Instructions](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/install.html)
2. Run the Vagrantfile in this repo [Vagrant Run Instructions](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/up.html)
3. Now you have a linux system that has run a script to install the latest version of this code.

## Build and Install
How to get the GNURadio Companion Tek RSA demo running:

0. Download the RSA_API.tar.gz file here: [RSA_API.tar.gz](https://github.com/tektronix/USB-RSA-gnuradio-module-WIP/releases/download/v0.1.2-alpha/RSA_API-0.13.211.tar.gz)
1. Run the command `sudo ./setup_build_env.sh` in the terminal. *Note: Previous step is required for this script to succeed.*
	- This script installs many dependencies and is expected to take
	several minutes. You will know the script finished successfully if
	the last line it prints says "Success: setup complete".

2. When that finishes, close the terminal that ran step 1 and open a new terminal.

3. In the new terminal, return to the project root directory
	and enter the command "gnuradio-companion" to verify
	the base program installed correctly. Then exit GNURadio Companion.

4. Enter the command `gedit ~/.gnuradio/grc.conf`.
	This will open the file "grc.conf" which will be edited in step 5.

5. Add the following lines to the bottom of the grc.conf file:
```
[grc]
local_blocks_path = /usr/local/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks/
```
6. Save the file changes and close the file.

7. Run the demo script `grc_RSA_demo.sh` in the "examples" directory.
	- Run it with super-user permission. 
	- This should open GNURadio Companion showing a simple setup
	- using the Tek RSA blocks.

8. Plug the RSA300 into the computer.

9. In GNURadio Companion, run the setup by clicking Run -> Execute in the toolbar,
	or by clicking the green triangle. A warning message may pop up, but this
	can be dismissed. If everything was set up correctly, you should see
	a Frequency vs. Power graph that is updating using output from the RSA.

## Use
This is the TekRSA-write-a-block package meant as a guide to building
out-of-tree packages. To use the TekRSA blocks, the Python namespaces
is in 'TekRSA', which is imported as:

    `import TekRSA`

See the Doxygen documentation for details about the blocks available
in this package. A quick listing of the details can be found in Python
after importing by using:

    `help(TekRSA)`
